My Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio

I am NIMAL and I want become a DATA SCIENTIST in the TECH SECTOR

I am interested in Data Science because I am a very curious person and whenever I find an insight I feel a small sense of accomplisment that motivates me to continue doing that.

My code is supposed to show basic mathematical functions

IN1=3+5
IN2=IN1/8
print(IN2)

Some different markdown cell representations:
